  <p>
    Advances in deep learning for human activity recognition have been relatively limited due to the lack of large labelled datasets. 
    In this study, we leverage self-supervised learning techniques on the UK-Biobank activity tracker dataset--the largest of 
    its kind to date--containing more than 700,000 person-days of unlabelled wearable sensor data. Our resulting activity 
    recognition model consistently outperformed strong baselines across seven benchmark datasets, with an F1 relative improvement 
    of 2.5%-100% (median 18.4%), the largest improvements occurring in the smaller datasets. In contrast to previous studies, 
    our results generalise across external datasets, devices, and environments. Our open-source model will help researchers and developers 
    to build customisable and generalisable activity classifiers with high performance.

# Summary
**We developed a foundation model for human activity recognition (HAR) using self-supervision. The pre-trained model is available to build high-performance human activity classifiers using accelerometer data.**


`harnet10` takes data that is 10-second long windows with 30hz of frequency. `harnet30` for 30-second long windows will be avaliable at
a later date.


We used self-supervision to train a ResNet16 V2 with 1D convolution. We inverted (arrow of the time), permuted, and time-warped the accelerometer data.

## Using the pre-trained model
```python
import torch
import numpy as np

repo = 'OxWearables/ssl-wearables'
harnet10 = torch.hub.load(repo, 'harnet10', class_num=5, pretrained=True)

x = np.random.rand(1, 3, 300)
x = torch.FloatTensor(x)
harnet10(x)
```

# Results

### Pre-trained models achieves high performance even with limited labelled datasets
